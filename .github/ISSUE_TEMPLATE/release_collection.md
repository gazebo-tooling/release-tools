## During development

- [ ] Work with artist on logo.

## Feature freeze

- [ ] Choose name for next release.
- [ ] Merge each library forward from previous versions
    * <!-- LINK PRS HERE -->
- [ ] Label pull requests being considered to enter release with [beta](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aignitionrobotics+label%3Abeta&state=open)
    Pull requests opened against the new collection after then:
    - Bug fixes: will be considered for the initial release and labeled `beta`
    - New features: will not be considered for the initial release.
- [ ] Pre-release libraries as all `beta` labels are merged.
    * <!-- LINK PRS HERE -->
- [ ] Make collection pre-release after all libraries are pre-released.
    * <!-- LINK PR HERE -->
- [ ] Update public documentation to install from pre-releases instead of nightlies ([example](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/docs/pull/196/files#diff-ebeee4adce7cb444f663b59020fb9f43f6f9adf36f63657b8afdeeea7a8530d1)).
    * <!-- LINK PR HERE -->
- [ ] Change nightlies to pre-release for release branches on `gzdev` ([example](https://github.com/gazebo-tooling/gzdev/pull/35))
    * <!-- LINK PR HERE -->

## Code freeze

- [ ] Start T-Shirt campaign
    * <!-- LINK POST HERE -->
- [ ] Hold tutorial party ([example](https://community.gazebosim.org/t/ignition-edifice-tutorial-party-support-open-source-and-get-t-shirts/866))
    * <!-- LINK POST HERE -->
- [ ] PRs fixing documentation and critical bugs can be merged and pre-released
- As libraries have all their documentation reviewed:
    - [ ] Create stable branches off of main
    - [ ] Make stable releases
        * <!-- LINK PRs HERE -->

## Release day

- [ ] Make collection stable release after all libraries are released.
    * <!-- LINK PR HERE -->

    * <!-- LINK PR HERE -->
- [ ] Make GitHub releases for all the X.0.0 versions ([example](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-transport/releases/tag/ignition-transport9_9.0.0))
- [ ] Update docs to say release is stable ([example](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/docs/pull/171))
    * <!-- LINK PR HERE -->
- [ ] Make announcement
    * <!-- LINK POST HERE -->

## Post-release

- [ ] Enable Jenkins CI for new stable branches ([example](https://github.com/gazebo-tooling/release-tools/pull/299))
    * <!-- LINK PR HERE -->
- [ ] Remove pre-release for release branches on `gzdev` ([example](https://github.com/gazebo-tooling/gzdev/pull/36))

    - [ ] Source code ([example](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-common/pull/193))
        * <!-- LINK PRs HERE -->
    - [ ] Add files to `gazebodistro` ([example](https://github.com/gazebo-tooling/gazebodistro/pull/12))
        * <!-- LINK PR HERE -->
    - [ ] Add aliases to `homebrew-simulation` ([example](https://github.com/osrf/homebrew-simulation/commit/1f8602af6f52e06e0542eebfbdbe97f5f6cf950c))
        * <!-- LINK PR HERE -->
    - [ ] Create new `-release` repositories (use [this script](https://github.com/gazebo-tooling/release-tools/blob/master/release-repo-scripts/new_ignition_release_repos.bash))
    - [ ] Enable nightlies for all `main` branches on `gzdev` ([example](https://github.com/gazebo-tooling/gzdev/pull/50))
    - [ ] Execute the tick-tock's "tock" for deprecations ([example](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-gazebo/pull/875))
        * <!-- LINK PRs HERE -->
- [ ] Update all repositories to default to the new stable branches.

If the collection will be officially paired with a ROS 2 distro:

- [ ] Update REP-2000 when ROS 2 distro is added ([example](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rep/pull/291))
- [ ] Import stable releases into https://packages.ros.org ([example](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/reprepro-updater/pull/109))
