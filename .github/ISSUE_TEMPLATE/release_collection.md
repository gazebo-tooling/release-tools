## During development

- [ ] Bump major version of libraries early in the development cycle (use [bump_libraries](bump_libraries.md) template).
- [ ] Work with artist on logo.

## Feature freeze

- [ ] Choose name for next release.
- [ ] Merge each library forward from previous versions
    * <!-- LINK PRS HERE -->
- [ ] Create stable branches off of `main`
    - [ ] `New branch` button on branches page ([example](https://github.com/gazebosim/sdformat/branches))
    - [ ] Enable CI for stable branches ([example](https://github.com/gazebo-tooling/release-tools/pull/787))
    - [ ] Use stable branch jobs in Jenkins view ([example part 1](https://github.com/gazebo-tooling/release-tools/pull/793) and [part 2](https://github.com/gazebo-tooling/release-tools/pull/806))
- [ ] Pull requests previously targeted at `main`:
    - Bug fixes:
       - Retarget to the new stable branch.
       - Label with [beta](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Agazebosim+label%3Abeta&state=open)
       - They can be merged until code freeze.
    - Backwards-compatible features, either:
       - Retarget them to the new stable branch (but they can only be merged after the stable release), or
       - Keep targeting `main` and backport after the stable release.
    - Breaking features:
       - Keep targeting `main` (i.e. they will be delayed until the next major release)
- [ ] Bump all `main` branches to the next major version (`X.0.0~pre1`)
    - [ ] Source code ([example](https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-common/pull/193))
