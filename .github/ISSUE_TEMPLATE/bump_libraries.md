about: Checklist when bumping major versions in a collection
title: "Bump in [COLLECTION]: [LIBRARIES]"
---

<!--

Use this template to keep track of everything that needs to be done to
bump the major version of a library within a collection.

For example, Ignition-X is currently under development, and it's using
ign-math42. This checklist includes all that's needed to use ign-math43
instead.

This script can be used to do most of the work:

https://github.com/gazebo-tooling/release-tools/blob/master/release-repo-scripts/bump_dependency.bash

When opening PRs, add a link back to this issue for easier tracking.
