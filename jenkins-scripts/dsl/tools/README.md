# Scripts for working with Jenkins DSL and gz-collections.yaml

## DSL 

DSL is the Jenkins plugins that allows to use code for creating
the different Jenkins jobs and configurations.

### setup_local_generation.bash (jobdsl.jar)

Script use to generate job configuration locally for Jenkins. See
[Jenkins script README](../README.md) 

## gz-collections.yaml

The `gz-collections.yaml` file stores all the metadata corresponding
to the different collections of Gazebo, the libraries that compose
each release and the metadata for creating the buildfarm jobs that
implement the CI and packaging.

The file is useful for scripts that use global information about the
Gazebo libraries.

### get_collections_from_package_and_version.py

The script return the Gazebo releases (also known as collections) that
contains a given library and major version that are provided as input
parameters.

The output is provided as a space separated list in a single line. If
no match is found, the result is an empty string.

#### Usage

```
./get_collections_from_package_and_version.py <lib_name> <major_version> <path-to-gz-collections.yaml>
```

Be sure of not including the major version number in the `<lib_name>`

#### Example

```
$./get_collections_from_package_and_version.py gz-cmake 4 ../gz-collections.yaml
```

That generates the result of:

```
ionic jetty
```
